# RAW-ML-LinearRegression
The task is to decide by means of linear regression whether we are able to **get rid of** any **gas sensor**, which is not necessary if there is a high **correlation** between other gases.</br>

In the solution you **shouldn't import** any libraries!

The solution is in the **jupyter notebook**.</br>
